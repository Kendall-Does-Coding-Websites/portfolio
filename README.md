# portfolio
Hey everyone,

This is my portfolio website, you can check it out [here](https://kendalldoescoding.gq). I followed a tutorial by Ania Kubow for my website, although, I added my own things, variations to it. The tutorial is linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D6oTPA4vXc)

# Important 
This github is made to upload our portfolio to my [current website](https://kendalldoescoding.gq)

If you have any issue, downloading the files from github, please reach out to me at kendall@kendalldoescoding.gq or on, contact@kendalldoescoding.gq


Thanks for your support on my projects,

- Owner and creator of the Kendall Portfolio,
